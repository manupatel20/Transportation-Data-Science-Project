# Transportation Data Science Project 

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes traffic crashes in Chicago to identify peak risk periods, major contributory factors, and correlations between crash causes and time of day. The goal is to provide insights for improving road safety through targeted interventions.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** [City of Chicago Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Vehicles/68nd-jvt3/data_preview)  
- **Description:** This dataset contains records of vehicle crashes in Chicago, including details such as crash times, causes, and vehicle involvement.  

## 📊 Google Colab Notebook  
- **Colab Link:** [Traffic Crash Analysis Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nP-a94mGZfkQ_L43ccvODPTOSE3amaLv)  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Visualization of crash trends  
  - Correlation studies of crash factors  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
### 🚗 Peak Crash Periods  
- **Morning Peak:** 7-9 AM  
- **Evening Peak:** 4-6 PM (more pronounced)  
- **Lowest Crash Rates:** 1-5 AM  

### ⚠️ Major Contributory Factors  
- **Exceeding Speed Limits** – Leading cause (66.07% of incidents)  
- **Turning Right on Red** – Significant issue at intersections (23.2% of crashes)  

### ⏳ Time-based Trends  
- Alcohol-related crashes increase at night  
- High traffic volumes contribute to peak crash rates  

## 📌 Future Research Directions  
- Investigating the impact of **weather conditions** on crash rates.  
- Evaluating the effectiveness of **traffic enforcement measures** such as speed limits and DUI checkpoints.
